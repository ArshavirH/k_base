/**
 * This package contains the Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs) for the application. SPIs define the contracts for
 * various services that can be implemented by different components or modules within the system. They facilitate loose
 * coupling and enhance the modularity of the application by allowing different implementations to be swapped in and out
 * without affecting the overall system architecture.
